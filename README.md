# PAINFUL STORY:
<h3>Let me share my painful story today with you. I have pain which can't be expressed in terms of words,expressions,feelings,tears,emotions or by no any means. Sometimes I thought that my pain doesn't exist either. So I decided to gain more pain, but the problem is that my thinking is that my type of pain doesn't exist. Even, sometimes I try to imagine my type of pain, but can't imagine. That can't be imagined, can't be felt' can't be expresed type pain is my pain. <h5>So everybody thats my pain.</h5>So painful pain.ðŸ¥²ðŸ˜¥</h3>
